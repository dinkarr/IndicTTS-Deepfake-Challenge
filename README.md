# IndicTTS-Deepfake-Challenge
Developed a deep learning model for detecting AI-generated speech across 16 Indian languages. Fine-tuned a WavLM-large model for audio classification, leveraging feature extraction and self-supervised learning techniques. Evaluated the model using ROC-AUC metrics to classify speech samples as either real or synthetic.
